### Pizza Hut
Pizza can be made with any combination of the toppings.
Pizza’s come in three sizes: Small, Medium or Large NOTE: This is **required** and must be set!
When the **eat()** method is called it should print out the pizza chain, the size and all of the toppings
specific to that pizza
Create a driver program to create three pizzas one of each size with 3, 6, and 9 toppings to your liking
and eat() all of them.

1) Now assume you purchased another two pizza chains, Little Caesars, and Dominos. You want to
add them to your program following the rules mentioned above.
